# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains three machine learning projects:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
2. **Iris Flower Classification**
3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**


## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
This project involves building a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin.

### Steps
1. **Load the Dataset**
2. **Initial Data Exploration**
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Feature Selection**
6. **Split the Dataset**
7. **Train the Models**
8. **Evaluate the Models**

### Key Findings
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models were used.
- Random Forest outperformed other models in predicting survival.

### Recommendations
- Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Explore more feature engineering techniques for better accuracy.

### Steps
1. **Load the Dataset**
2. **Initial Data Exploration**
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Feature Selection**
6. **Split the Dataset**
7. **Train the Models**
8. **Evaluate the Models**

### Key Findings
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models all performed well.
- Random Forest had the highest accuracy.

### Recommendations
- Implement cross-validation for better generalization.
- Consider additional feature engineering for improved performance.

 
 ## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

### Steps
1. **Load the Dataset**
2. **Initial Data Exploration**
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Handle Class Imbalance**
6. **Split the Dataset**
7. **Train the Models**
8. **Evaluate the Models**

### Key Findings
